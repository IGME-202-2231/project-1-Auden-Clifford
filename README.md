[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet)

### Student Info

-   Name: AUDEN CLIFFORD

## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: topdown
-   Camera Movement: follows player
-   Player Health: heathbar; tied to rotational velocity (you die when you stop spinning)
-   End Condition: game ends when the player dies; the object is to get as high a score as possible before that happens
-   Scoring: kills and time; time acts as base points, kills multiply score

### Game Description

SPINNERSCORGE, beyblades with guns. In spinnerscorge, you play as a spinner/top and must survive as long as possible against other spinners. If you stop spinning your out of the game, you loose rotation speed by being hit by other spinners and gain rotation when you get kills. Whenever two spinners collide they both lose some rotation speed and go flying apart! However, the player is equipped with a gun which can chip away at enemy spinner's rotation at range. The player only regains speed from kills done via bumping into enemies. Therefore the player must use the gun to slow down enemies and then go in for the kill at melee range.

### Controls

    -   Down: S
    -   Left: A
    -   Right: D

## You Additions

The additions I made are the health system being tied to rotation, and the unique way kills effect said health system.
